## General Information

This is a program which helps people to to do statistical calculations and drawings via the values retrieving by external sources(in version 1.0.0 only binance is available as external source) or using manuel imports.I would want to say that some ready files(these are the informations retrieved by exchange market:iotausdt.json,hbarusdt.json,btcusdt.json,ethusdt.json and xmrusdt.json . Also one excel file is included as an example for outputting json data to excel.) to do experimental data analysis are also included and you can convert datas getten by binance into excel format. 
It is in version 1.0.0 for the moment and some big improvements will be realesed to this application sooner. Some of them are t-contribution(to do estimation using samples defined on the normal curves),alpha vintage and also artificial learning algorithms.
I would be glad if you open an issue in case you remarked any bugsðŸ™‚
